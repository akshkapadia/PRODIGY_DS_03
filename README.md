# Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This project builds a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. We use the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Overview

The goal is to create a predictive model that can help businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively by identifying customers who are likely to make a purchase.

## Dataset

We use the [Bank Marketing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes various customer attributes and whether they subscribed to a term deposit.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature selection and engineering
- Decision tree classifier implementation
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Interpretability analysis
